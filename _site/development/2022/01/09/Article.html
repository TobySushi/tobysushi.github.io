<h2 id="jan-9-2022-by-sushi"><strong>Jan 9, 2022 by: Sushi</strong></h2>

<p>Hey! Welcome to my page on the net!</p>

<p>Its so exciting to finally have this site open, online, and on a proper domain. For quite some time now ive been wanting to make a proper website for my artwork, commision information, as well as a blog to make posts like this.
By the time you’re reading this the website will most likely be far from finished, with a few bits and bobs redirecting to an “under construction” page. Despite this, I hope you (the reader) decide to keep up to date with my various ramblings here!</p>

<p>The rest of this article will be discussing both the programming and artistic development of this website so far, and I hope you take the time to read about the struggles and triumphs I came across while developing this site! If you’re not interested in that, why not take the time to check out some of the other places this site has to offer so far! You wont regret it!</p>

<h2 id="3-years-of-procrastination"><strong>3 Years of Procrastination</strong></h2>

<p>Well… where do I even start!?</p>

<p>For about 3 years the files for this website have been tucked away in a messy little MEGA cloud drive while lots have gone on with my personal life. Checking those dates the creation of this website to October of 2019. At the time I was just beginning my Junior year of High School, and was nearing a pretty rough time for myself. At the time the website looked COMPLETELY different than what you’re looking at right now. It was reflective of what I thought a cool website would look like, and looking back on it, it was pretty damn unconventional. On the far edges of the screen sat the header and sidebar, somehing more akin to documentation for some dated 2000’s software. The header was the size of a twinkie, and had big pixel-art buttons adorning it.  <br />
At the time, I was going for a “pixel-art” look, since that was what I excelled in at the time (my transition into digital art wouldnt start until december of that year). There were strange pixelated clouds and smoke icons here and there, and an intrusive, color changing scrolling background.</p>

<p><img src="\Graphics\Article images\Jan9-2022\oldsite.PNG" alt="My old, antiquated website" /> 
<em>thankfully I was able to find an old picture of the website</em></p>

<p>After the first “big push” with the website in 2019, I went on quite a big hiatus from its development. I have absolutely no clue when this hiatus ended, but referencing the github repo, as well as files I have saved, it looks like the next time I really worked on it was in 2020. At the time I still adopted the old chunky look, but not much happened during that time other than development work on the article / blog system, as well as fixing the footer positioning almost non stop.</p>

<p><img src="\Graphics\Article images\Jan9-2022\commits.PNG" alt="An image of my github commits." /> 
<em>Make sure to name your commmits properly, as such</em></p>

<p>After this, the big changes to the websites look came about around May of 2021. At the time, I created a brand new logo for sushipop, which kept the airstream font look, but better reflected the art and content I was creating at the time. It had a little sushi ear, sparkles, and hearts. All things that were commonplace in my artstyle. Ill be honest, im still thrilled with how clean the logo turned out.</p>

<p><img src="\Graphics\Article images\Jan9-2022\newlogo2.PNG" alt="My old logo compared to my new one" /></p>

<p>With this new logo, I changed up the look of the website. The first thing to go was the big “widescreen” chunky look. Putting the website on a 1440p monitor made all the content so spread out, and it felt like reading a page was a bigger journey than the damn Odyessy. Meanwhile I constantly struggled to keep the footer in place, but everything ended up looking pretty good despite that. Honestly most of the work was done by the time May of 2021 wrapped up.  <br />
Past that point, however, I went on another hiatus, constantly thinking about how nice it would be to have a nice website to put my things on, especially for my commision work. I worked on a few things here and there, but never made much meaningful progress until (literally) a few days ago.</p>

<p>But! I think one of the biggest bits of progress in the past few days was telling myself not everything had to be perfect in order to actually launch the site. That leads me to the next thing I want to talk about!</p>

<h2 id="the-sushipop-website-going-forward"><strong>The Sushipop Website: Going Forward</strong></h2>

<p>As mentioned before, this site isnt really done just yet. I still have plenty of plans for content I want to add.</p>

<p>If you’ve done any clicking around the site yet, you’ll realize that lots of the stuff on the header isnt even finished yet. Call it lazy, or unfinished, but I would rather have something up right now rather than nothing, its a good insentive for me to actually go forward on those other pages. Examples of which would be the art gallery page, and really fleshing out my commisions page.</p>

<p>Im so excited to really put some meaningful content on this site, and I hope you all stick around for it! I hope this article was entertaining, and an interesting insight to some of the process behind this website! Thanks for reading my very first blog post!</p>
